    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This peanut butter recipe calls for just 1 or 2 ingredients, and it comes together in under 10 minutes. Still, making it is a blast! You get to watch whole peanuts transform into the smoothest, creamiest nut butter you’ve ever seen. Its oozy texture beats any store bought brand I’ve tried, and its rich peanut flavor is out of this world. You won’t be able to resist eating it by the spoonful!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups dry roasted & salted or unsalted peanuts</li>
        <li>Sea salt, to taste (if using unsalted peanuts)</li>
        <li>4 tbsp honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the peanuts in a medium food processor.* Process until very smooth, stopping every 30 seconds to 1 minute to scape down the sides of the bowl, as necessary, and to give the food processor's motor a break. The mixture will be chunky at first. Then, it'll thicken into a ball, and finally, it will become creamy and smooth. The whole process should take about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add salt and honey</li>
        <li>enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
